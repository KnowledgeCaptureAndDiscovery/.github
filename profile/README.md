## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
We develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches that use knowledge to accelerate and innovate scientific discovery processes that are unnecessarily carried out manually and inefficiently today.

We work on a variety of AI research areas, such as semantic workflows, human-guided machine learning, interdisciplinary model integration, knowledge networks, controlled crowdsourcing of metadata, and automated hypothesis-driven discovery. A key theme in our projects is the use of AI technologies for different aspects of data science processes in order to make them more efficient.
